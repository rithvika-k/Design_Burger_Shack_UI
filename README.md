Designing a Burger Shack Interface

Storyline: Burger Shack is a family restaurant that is quickly becoming Brampton’s fastest growing fast food chain. 
The owners have asked to create a program to help them manage the restaurant’s growing demands.

Their menu includes the following: Burgers, Sides, and Drinks

NOTE: These are the additional things/features I added to my program:
1. Combo option - with burger of choice, fries, and medium drink of choice
2. Veggie burger option - no meat option so that all customers are able to eat/buy something
3. Introduction - where I promt for the user/customer name so that it is more interactive
4. Use mathematical operators to show the user how much they save with the combo deal
5. stored the various drink types in a variable include the new line syntax so that when it is called it will be printed as a list
6. The "Eating on a budget" uses the min() function to find the cheapest item from the arguments I passed in
7.  If statments prompt the user for the drink they want with each combo selected
8.  If statments prompt the user the type of drink they want for each size they selected
9.  Added an Order Confirmation where the customer can confirm the items they selected - includes the items they selected 0 for
10. Added a Receipt - excludes the items they selected 0 for
11. Added Donations and Tips
12. Added a Transaction section
13. Added a Receipt- Customer Copy - excludes the items they selected 0 for - includes donations, tips, transaction
14. User gives a rating for the service
